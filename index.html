        Everyday digital interfaces include a rich variety of images,
        visualizations, and other pictures. However, more than anything else,
        they are made of words. Oh so many words. As we equip teams to design
        and code usable, consistent, beautiful interfaces using systems, its
        essential that words depend on a strong foundation of typography. <br><br>
         I’ll
        admit, I am not a typography expert. I lack a graphic design degree. I’m
        never the person choosing a font, scaling type, or finessing letter
        spacing. As a result, I’ve always been reluctant to write about
        typography. <br><br> On the other hand, I am a pattern hunter. Over the years,
        I’ve contributed to many design systems that set a foundation for
        typography. Each traversed of steps and decisions to set a foundation
        and apply it to an emerging library of interface components. This
        article summarizes those patterns. <br><br> Typography starts by setting a
        foundation of font families and weights along with fallbacks. It then
        explores how to build hierarchy using size, color, additional details
        like line-height, and layering responsiveness. Those models are then
        applied to components in a system’s library (like Article and Header) as
        well as custom components made by other teams.
